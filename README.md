# IVI-Coda

## Introduction
This is the IVI app in Coda: a native Android application following MVVM architecture for the best performance. 


The app is designed to run on Android Automotive OS 15 with the [Coda]() vendor package on a Raspberry Pi 5. Note that the app utilises custom VHAL properties and AIDL interfaces, and lots of custom logic that is necessary for building the app and running it successfully. You can simply utilise the created [repo manifest]() to fetch everything related to the IVI Node for you if you want to run it yourself.
